# RML Mapping and KG Construction

In order to automatically create KGs we defined mapping rules for transforming input data into semantic web knowledge graphs, according to the developed Visual Sense ontology.

For this purpose, we used RML standard….

Specifically, we utilized pyRML…. a tool developed by Andrea Nuzzolese

# PyRML Mapping Rules

The mapping rules (in turtle format) are hereby available (vs_mapping_rules.ttl).

There is a total of ?? rules, with ??? logical sources and ?? triple maps. Most of the logical sources are the json files, but in this first iteration one subset of data had to be converted into CSVs. Therefore, there is now also a CSV logical source...

A first Knowledge Graph of one image has already been published here. The KG instantiates all classes defined by the Visual Sense ontology, and contains information about...
