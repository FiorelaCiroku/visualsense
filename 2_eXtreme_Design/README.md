# Using the eXtreme Design Methodology

This knowledge engineering project has followed the eXtreme Design (XD) methodology proposed by Bloomqvist. eXtreme Design (XD) is an ontology design methodology whose core principle is ontology design patterns (ODP) reuse, as an explicit activity. ODPs are small ontologies which, ideally, form the bigger ontology with the correct alignment. They mediate between use cases (problem types) and design solutions.
